Small things. Now with no 8 minute timer every time you try to play Minecraft.

This mod requires [AutoRegLib](https://github.com/Vazkii/AutoRegLib).

This mod does NOT need the original [Quark](https://github.com/Vazkii/Quark) (and will not run with the original Quark).

This mod is compatible with [Quark Oddities](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/quark-oddities).

This mod makes use of the [Java Universal Tween Engine](https://github.com/AurelienRibon/universal-tween-engine) by Aurelien Ribon, licensed under the Apache 2.0 License.
