# How to remove timer from Quark
---
1. Get the Quark [Source Code](https://github.com/Vazkii/Quark) by pressing "Clone or Download", then "Download ZIP".
2. Extract the ZIP file. Rename the extracted file to "quark" for future reference.
3. Go to `Quark-master/src/main/java/vazkii/quark/base/client`.
4. Delete "anything with `BMHandler` in the name.
5. Go back to `Quark-master`. Run the "build.bat" file (the one with all the gears).
6. When that is done, go to the `quark` folder. Open up the new folder, and in those you have your version of Quark without the timer.
